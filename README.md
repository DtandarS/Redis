# Redis

Making my personal own redis with C++

This is mainly just to get myself to commit to one and only one project at the time. Something challenging but still rewarding. This my attempt to create something I don't understand and turn that knowledge into great wise. 

The criteria for this project is

- [ ] Must be hard so that I won't cheese through it without learning but easy enough to understand so that I have to think critically. 
- [ ] Is something I haven't done before.
- [ ] Is usefull knowledge for the future 

I personally think `Redis` is probably the best place to start learning project based learning since it goes through very specific stuff that you don't go through untill like uni or higher education. 
And I personally is not in school so my plan is to use this as portfolio product in order to get job or something else.

Plan is to write everything myself. No AI interventions. Just pure reading and understanding.
